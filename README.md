## Do Christian greeting cards only work for religious occasions?

Not at all. Christian cards work for any occasion—birthdays, sympathy, encouragement, thank you, or just because. The difference is they incorporate scripture or faith-based messages that resonate with believers, adding spiritual encouragement to everyday moments rather than limiting use to specifically religious events.

## Are boxed cards more economical than buying individual cards?

Yes, boxed sets typically cost $1-3 per card compared to $3-6 for individual cards at retail. Buying boxes when on sale (often 50-70% off) brings per-card costs under $1. This makes stocking up smart for frequent card senders who want quality options ready without last-minute shopping trips.

## Can I send Christian ecards for free?

Several services including CrossCards and DaySpring offer completely free Christian ecards you can personalize and send via email without subscriptions. Others like Blue Mountain and American Greetings provide limited free options alongside premium subscriptions that unlock unlimited sending and expanded selections.
